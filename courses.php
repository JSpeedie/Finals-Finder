 *     * a dropdown menu for selecting an exam to get the final's info for
 *     * a table containing all the selected final's info
 * This file essentially just references the necessary html since I made the design choice
 * to have everything done in courses.php so that the user can view the info for multiple finals
 * without having to open a new page or window.
